# dataviz_project
Generate exploratory visualisations that help understand the data and explanatory visualisations that explain findings 

The data we'll be using for this part of the project were downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aaronschlegel/seattle-pet-licenses/data), and include information about "pet licenses issued by the Seattle Animal Shelter between 2005 and early 2017." We'll be exploring these data and generating a few exploratory plots in the first part of the project.
